"I like making this place mine, keeping it clean and fresh for anyone who comes by.",
"Look, the fire is blue right now, that is so cool!",
"Have you ever tried making a fire all on your own?",
"You never actually see trees growing, they grow too slowly.",
"And so I kept dreaming like it was real life.",
