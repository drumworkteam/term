<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

_Note: Tune is just in the prototype phases right now._

Tune is a [#conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) ("constructed language") that takes influence from English, Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, Sanskrit, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Arabic, Japanese, Tamil, and Hawaiian. Words are typically derived from English, though a few come from these other languages. Its phonology (i.e. the sounds it uses) is quite simple, only consisting of 19 simple consonant sounds and 5 basic vowel sounds. It is a mostly "analytic" language, meaning that pretty much everything is divided into words instead of having word inflections or word morphology changes. However we have taken the opportunity in a few cases to compress some words by shortening them and making them into suffixes, for extremely common paradigms like using verbs in the past tense. In addition, you can form words by joining them together separated by an appropriate vowel, so it is in a sense fusional and agglutinative as well to a small degree. There are no tones (like in Chinese), or clicks, like in some African languages.

One goal of tune is to create a language which can be used for programming (using very short words), and for speaking at the same time. The end goal is to define words that will help you think holistically about the universe and see its beautiful structure in great detail and clarity, to the point where you are so capable of seeing it that you can also read it in code. Code is highly structured information that is ideally unambiguous, so seeing the universe as code would be an extraordinary thing.

First we will outline the phonology in more detail so you know what to expect and how to write the words on a typical keyboard in ASCII. Next, we will go into some of the basic word forms and show you how to construct some basic words. Finally, we will show how we can build up the lexicon to eventually include all of the millions of English words in existence, from molecules to life forms to locations, etc..

See the [contributing guide](https://github.com/drumworkteam/tune/blob/make/.github/contributing.md) for the intricate details on how things work, and how to contribute.

### Knowledge Representation

All things are actually a `xix` under the hood (pronounced "sheesh", see [call script](https://github.com/drumworkteam/call) for pronunciation details). In English we are calling this a "shift" or "tropon", an action-object. The `xix` is then divided into `xiq` ("shing") "action" and `xaq` ("shaung") "object". A generic "shift type" is a `kix` "keesh", an action type being a `kiq` ("king") and an object type a `kaq` ("kong").

Can call a "fox" a "small wild canine". Can call a "canine" a "carnivorous animal". Can call an animal a "living structure". So a "fox" becomes a "small wild carnivorous living structure". But that is too long of a name, so for common stuff you give it a short name, in our case a 5-letter c-v-c-v-c word. The question is, what do you pick to give a common name to?

### Parts of Speech

All words are `xix` in their base form. They manifest into actions and objects and modifiers/features by suffixing the words with singular vowels.

- `-i`: The `xix` is a `xiq` (action).
- `-a`: The `xix` is a `xaq` (object).
- `-o`: The `xix` is a `xoq` (feature).

### Representing Self and Other

- `baq`: self
- `biq`: other
- `boq`: self and other

### Singular vs. Plural

All things are singular by default, so you just need to mark them the plural particle suffixing the main shift.

- `-ya`: many

This comes as a sortened form of `yaq`.

### Tense

Tense is marked by particles as well. Present is the default tense.

- `-ho`: past, shortened form of `hoq`.
- `-hi`: future, shortened form of `hiq`.
- `-ha`: currently active (-ing in English), shortened form of `haq`.

Note, there have evolved to be many "suffixes". You can tell what a suffix is by looking for an internal `h`. Regular words can begin with an `h`, but an `h` cannot fall in the middle of a word unless what follows is a suffix.

### Focusers

The words like "the", "a", "this", and "that" are focusers. They focus attention on aspects of the speaking context.

- `la`: the
- `ka`: a
- `fa`: this
- `fi`: that

### Representing I, you, and it

These words are so common they also dropped the `q` sound at the end.

- `do`: I, me, or myself.
- `bo`: You.
- `go`: It.
- `wo`: We.
- `yo`: You all.
- `mo`: Them.
- `go vako`: female
- `go hako`: male

### Basic Nouns

The following is an intro list of nouns so you can see how sentences are formed. Remember, all nouns are manifestations of the underlying `xix`, so these are the `xix` forms and need to be prefixed by `xa`.

- `xudip`: tree
- `xulif`: leaf
- `xusid`: seed
- `xubin`: fruit
- `xurak`: rock
- `xuroz`: flower

### Basic Verbs

The following is an intro list of verbs so you can soon see how sentences are formed. Remember, all verbs are manifestations of the underlying `xix`, so these are the `xix` forms and need to be prefixed by `xi`.

- `xum`: live
- `ris`: rise
- `mad`: flow
- `sim`: be
- `mek`: make
- `hov`: have
- `xinax`: shine
- `gorom`: grow
- `nezal`: smell
- `gesol`: see
- `kuxar`: hear
- `lison`: listen

### Basic Noun Modifiers

These are typically known as adjectives. The following is an intro list of adjectives so you can see how sentences are formed. All adjectives are manifestations of the underlying `xix`, so these are the `xix` forms and need to be prefixed by `xu`.

- `gab`: big
- `bag`: small
- `nub`: new
- `bun`: old

Some word endings are:

- `lix`: `x-ish` (it kind of has this property)
- `kom`: `x-al` (like)
- `dis`: `x-ive` (producing)
- `fol`: `x-ful` (full)
- `kan`: `x-able` (to be able)
- `pak`: `x-ing` (in process)
- `lof`: `x-less` (without)
- `hev`: (having/with)
- `deq`: (from/of)
- `xan`: `x-tion`, `x-ment`, `x-age`, `x-al`, and `x-ure` (result)
- `pum`: `x-er` (action performer)
- `mup`: `x-ee` and `x-ant` (action receiver)
- `xak`: `x-ery` (craft)

You can use them like:

- `xomadolixo` (reddish)
- `dipakomo` (tree-like)
- `solaridiso` (sunlight producing)
- `karelifolo` (careful)
- `mekikano` (makeable)
- `rasipako` (processing)
- `karelilofo` (careless)
- `pelomahevo` (hairy)

### Basic Verb Modifiers

- `venoha`: eventually

### Basic Colors

### Basic Logic

- `vi`: and
- `vu`: or
- `pi`: if
- `pu`: then
- `na`: not
- `ma`: all
- `ti`: true
- `ta`: false

### Basic Sentences

_Note: A more up-to-date translation of some sentences should be found [here](https://github.com/drumworkteam/tune/blob/make/list/sentence/full.csv)._

Sentences follow the SVO subject-verb-object format. Modifiers/features/adjectives precede the main verb or noun.

> I see the tree

```
do gezi la xudipa
```

> Black and white are all I see.

```
xonano vi xomano simi yu do gezi
```

> The water flows.

```
la sawasa madiha
```

### Animate Material Beings

All of these start with `xum`, meaning "life" or "to live", followed by `a`, so `xuma`. They are described uniquely mostly by adding 1, 2, 3, or 4 suffixes onto `xum`.

- `xumaman`: woman
- `xumanan`: man
- `xumazon`: human

Note, these are the _technical_ names for the beings, there could also be a set of _common names_ for such beings. These technical names are going to be derived and translated from the Latin names in the biological taxonomy.

### Inanimate Material Beings

All of these start with `dal` or `dala`, meaning "body". These are for things like atoms, molecules, liquids, gasses like stars, solids like rocks and dirt.

### Molecules and Atoms

These are described by the effect they have on the world in some way as inanimate objects, by prefixing each word with `wiv`. The simplest one, `wivoxum` is carbon, meaning "life mesh" or "life network". These are going to be translated from the IUPAC chemical name standards.

- `wivasawasa`: hydrogen
- `wivasolara`: helium
- `wivaxuraka`: lithium
- `wivavilara`: berylium
- `wivaborona`: boron
- `wivaxuma`: carbon
- `wivamuxa`: nitrogen
- `wivabita`: oxygen
- `wivamada`: fluorine

### Constellations

All of these start with `nava` for navigation.

### Mathematical Structures

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_named_matrices

### Fields of Study

Any field of study starts with `lag`, or when a noun `laga`. For example, mathematics, or abstraction study, it would be `lagasuruka`, or science (the study of nature) is `lagadoza`, or art (the study of creation) as `lagameka`.

### Tools

Tools are any created objects and are prefixed by `tula`, meaning tool.

### Numbers

- `han`: zero
- `zen`: one
- `dos`: two
- `san`: three
- `lom`: four
- `kam`: five
- `xat`: six
- `vip`: seven
- `fet`: eight
- `nav`: nine
- `bap`: ten
- `pak`: eleven
- `mod`: twelve

Then to make more, you do binary, with `i` meaning raise to the power.

Cardinal numbers (first, second)

- `-oho`

Times numbers (once, twice)

- `-ohi`

### Colors

Colors begin with `xed` ("color"), but is shortened to just `x` on simple color names, like `xanen` is black.

You can talk about color wheel values with `xedawil`, so `xedawilazenapona` or something like that.

### Geographic Places

As [what3words.com](https://what3words.com) shows, you can at least name every 3x3 meter area on Earth with 3 simple English words (since that amounts to something like 10-ish million 3x3 meter areas I think). In a similar way, we will name geographic places, starting with `zon` meaning "land".

### Generic types

Generic types are `kix` and are divided into action types `kiq` and object types `kaq`. This is used to describe the abstract things, especially used in modeling and representation like used in code.

A function call, for example, is called a `kiqakal`.

<h3 id="mount">DrumWork</h3>

The tune language is being developed by the folks at [DrumWork](https://drum.work), a California-based project for helping humanity master information and computation. DrumWork started off in the winter of 2008 as a spark of an idea, to formalizing the work 10 years later in the winter of 2018, now just beginning its development phases. DrumWork funds the development here. It is entirely bootstrapped by working full time and running [Etsy](https://etsy.com/shop/drumworkteam) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=p_27%3AMount+Build) shops. Also find us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/drumworkteam), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drumworkteam), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/drumworkteam).
