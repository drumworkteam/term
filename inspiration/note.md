Each word has a corresponding definition and English translation.

miw

Each word can use scoping words based on its defined criteria. The set of all words, special sets of words, etc.

Within a certain scope you can use custom words and words can have different meaning. These are defined on a one-off basis.

miwk
  ta

  ra

  pa
    ...

  pro
    ...

You can create sort of mixins like this to use. In this way, too, the language is well-defined and programmatic.

ma is a verb _separator_ so you don't need it to start.

da = start noun/feature context.

is
xik

xik ma ki ta bred spot ma xow mi ma jiw ni lo xaw
